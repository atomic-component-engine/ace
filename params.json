{"name":"Atomic Component System","tagline":"This is a yeoman generator for an atomic design system","body":"ACS v0.1.7 - *PRE-RELEASE*\r\n=======================\r\n\r\n\r\n* [Quick Start](#quick)\r\n\t* [Getting Started](#getting-started)\r\n \t* [ACS Init](#acs-init)\r\n \t* [Component generation](#component-generation)\r\n \t* [Page generation](#page-generation)\r\n\r\n* [Todos](#todos)\r\n\r\nACS is a system for creating and maintaining Frontend projects. It builds on the ideas forwarded by [Brad Frost](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) where instead of designing pages, we design and develop a system of components. \r\n\r\nThis system has 2 main elements. The boilerplate, which consists of a Grunt based project, and a component generator, both of which are managed by Yeoman. \r\n\r\n\r\n###Quick Start\r\n\r\n#### Getting Started\r\n\r\n1. Download the [zip](https://github.com/pjhauser/atomic-component-system/archive/master.zip).\r\n2. `cd` into the yeoman directory\r\n3. Run `npm install -g`\r\n4. Run `npm link`\r\n5. cd into the working directory of your project\r\n6. Run `yo acs init` and follow the instructions\r\n\r\n\r\n#### ACS Init\r\nThis task initialises the directory with the main boilerplate. You will be asked 4 questions:\r\n\r\n1. Do you want to init this directory with ACS (Y/n)\r\n2. What is the base URL of the directory? *This is for the script and css paths of the template*\r\n3. Are you using Git? *This will add the base gitignore*\r\n4. Do you want your name and email to be placed in the header of all of the compoenents you create? *This is useful in teams and acs will read these details from your gitconfig if present*\r\n\r\n\r\nNow your directory has the base boilerplate you'll want to start creating components. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Component generation\r\n\r\nYou can use the same yeoman generator to create components. Just type:\r\n\r\n1. yo acs\r\n2. Select component type\r\n3. Name component\r\n4. *(optional)* Type name\r\n5. *(optional)* Enter email\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Page generation\r\n\r\nPages are a little different to compoenents, ideally these should have minimal CSS and JS, as this should all be performed on the sub-page component level. \r\n\r\n1. yo acs page\r\n2. Name component / page\r\n3. Select template type\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n### Todos \r\n* Create an example webpage using this generator. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
