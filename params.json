It builds on the ideas forwarded by [Brad Frost](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) where instead of designing pages, we design and develop a system of components. \r\n\r\nThis system has 2 main elements. [The boilerplate](https://github.com/pjhauser/front-end-boilerplate), which consists of a Grunt based project, and a [component generator](https://github.com/pjhauser/component-generator) which is based on Yeoman. \r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal is to merge these two into a single Yeoman dependency. One to initialise and one to maintain. \r\n\r\n### Object orientation in the Frontend\r\nAtomic design is an Object Oriented methodology for frontend development. It focuses on creating a set of base components, and inheriting them into parent component groups. \r\n\r\n![Atomic Design Diagram](http://bradfrostweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/atomic-design.png)\r\n\r\nThis this method of inheritance is not yet possible with HTML and CSS. We need an abstraction layer and build process. This is where we introduce three fundamental aspects of ACS. \r\n\r\n* [Jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade)\r\n* [SASS](https://github.com/nex3/sass)\r\n* [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt)\r\n\r\nJade and SASS form our abstraction layers, and Grunt forms our build process. \r\n\r\nJade offers a flexible templating engine that allows for mixins and includes. The flexibility of the engine and it's compatibility with Grunt. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Nitty Gritty\r\n#### Boilerplate\r\nIf you clone the [main boilerplate project](https://github.com/pjhauser/front-end-boilerplate) this gives you the project scaffolding and Gruntfile. Eventually this can be moved into a Yeoman generator but for now just clone the project and rename the directory to you're respective component factory. \r\n\r\n#### Component factory\r\nOnce you have the boilerplate in you'll need to install the Yeoman component generator. This is the day-to-day generator. [Grab the project](https://github.com/pjhauser/component-generator) and `cd` into the directory. Once in you'll want to `npm install -g` which will install the generator, and then `npm link`. \r\n\r\nNow you'll have the generator installed and ready to use. \r\n\r\n#### File structure\r\n\tsrc\r\n\t  | --> /atoms\r\n\t  \t\t   |--> /atom_name\r\n\t  \t\t\t\t  | --> atom_name.jade\r\n\t  \t\t\t\t  | --> atom_name.js\r\n\t  \t\t\t\t  | --> atom_name.sass\r\n\t  \t\t\t\t  | --> demo_atom_name.jade\r\n\t  \t\t\t\t  \t\t  \t  \r\n\t  | --> /molecules\r\n\t  | --> /organisms\r\n\t  | --> /templates\r\n\t  | --> /global-js\r\n\t  | --> /global-sass\r\n\r\n\r\n### Todos \r\n* Merge the two projects into a single yeoman project. \r\n* Create an example webpage using this generator. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
