## Example ACE Website

This is a simple example and playground for testing out ACE.

To configure this change the `baseURL` in the `ace_config.json` to your local server directry that points to this project. 

To get it up and running you just need to run `npm install` and `grunt`.

When you open it up in the browser you can navigate to `/dev/molecules/_content_block/_demo_content_block.html`

This page contains an example molecule, that is based on two currently unstyled atoms.

Another example can be found in the main page template in the form of a `header`. This header consists of 2 atoms which can be found in the `atoms` directory.
